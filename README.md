# FORGE

**F**used **O**ptimization & **R**easoning for **G**enerative **E**ngineering

FORGE is my personal AI development laboratory for extending and contributing to the PAI (Personal AI Infrastructure) ecosystem.

## What is FORGE?

FORGE is NOT a competing project to PAI. It's a:
- **Development workspace** for experimenting with PAI enhancements
- **Methodology hub** for documenting my approach to AI-assisted development
- **Contribution pipeline** for submitting improvements back to upstream projects
- **Cross-project context system** for managing AI agents across multiple products

## Project Goals

1. **Extend PAI** with new capabilities:
   - opencode.ai compatibility (platform-agnostic PAI)
   - Party mode (multi-agent collaboration inspired by BMAD METHOD)
   - Daily status reporting for team/project management
   - Customizable agent teams with shared context

2. **Contribute Back** to the OSS community:
   - Submit PRs to danielmiessler/PAI
   - Share learnings and patterns
   - Build on the shoulders of giants

3. **Support My Work**:
   - Company: Multi-product development with persistent agent context
   - Home: Personal projects with the same powerful tooling

## Inspiration & Attribution

FORGE synthesizes concepts from three MIT-licensed projects:

- **PAI** (MIT) © Daniel Miessler
  - Foundation: Personal AI infrastructure, skill system, agent patterns

- **BMAD METHOD v6** (MIT) © BMad Code, LLC
  - Multi-agent collaboration patterns, party mode concept

- **opencode.ai** (MIT) © SST Team
  - Terminal-based agent architecture, multi-provider approach

FORGE reimplements these concepts natively for cross-project context and multi-product development workflows.

## Getting Started

See [docs/methodology.md](docs/methodology.md) for the FORGE development approach.

See [docs/features/](docs/features/) for planned enhancements.
